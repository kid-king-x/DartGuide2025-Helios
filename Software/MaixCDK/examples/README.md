MaixCDK Examples
==========

Examples in this directory are cross-platform, which means they can run on any platform supported by MaixCDK.
e.g. Camera demo.

All examples name should be start with noun like `image_show` but not `show_image`.


Specific platform examples should be placed in `MaixCDK/test` directory.
e.g. cvi_tpu_demo, which directly call MaixCam's cpu's SDK's API, not MaixCDK's API.


The official open source projects based on MaixCDK like `MaixPy` source code, are in `MaixCDK/projects` directory.
