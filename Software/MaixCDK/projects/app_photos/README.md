Displaying Images and Playing Videos

## Displaying Images
When the program starts, it will read and display images from the `/maixapp/share/picture/` directory. The program supports `jpg` and `png` image formats. It is recommended that the image resolution does not exceed `2560x1440`, and the width must be a multiple of `32`.

## Displaying Videos
When the program starts, it will read videos from the `/maixapp/share/video/` directory. The program supports playing, pausing, and setting the playback position. Only `mp4` videos encoded in the `H.264` format are supported. It is recommended that the video resolution does not exceed `2560x1440`, and the width must be a multiple of `32`.
